ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hernan. I am a biologist and, now I'm doing my PhD in the school of medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, in visual neuroscience. Currently, 
I am doing my PhD in the retinal neurochemistry and experimental ophthalmology laboratory (Head director: Dra. Ruth Rosenstein) where we focus on the study of mechanisms involved 
in different retinal neurodegenerative diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
