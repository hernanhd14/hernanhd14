- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hernanhd14. I am a biologist and I am a PhD student at the school of medicine, Univesity of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Iâ€™m interested in neuroscience. Currently, 
I am doing my PhD in the retinal neurochemistry and experimental ophthalmology laboratory (Head director: Dra. Ruth Rosenstein) where we focus on the study of mechanisms involved 
in different retinal neurodegenerative diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
